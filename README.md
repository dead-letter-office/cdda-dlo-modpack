## Lockable Doors

Makes three types of door locakble:

- Ordinary wood doors (on houses, evac centers etc)
- Reinforced wood doors
- 'Pickable' metal doors

(C)losing any of these doors while they're already closed will lock them.

(O)pening the locked door from inside will unlock it. The second (O)pen will open it.

! This makes it possible to lock yourself out !

Prying and lockpicking work as normal.

Also includes an 'Add Latch to Door' construction recipe to turn an ordinary metal door into a lockable metal door.
